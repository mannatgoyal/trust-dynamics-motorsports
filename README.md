## Overview

F1 Race Strategy Optimizer is an interactive Streamlit dashboard combining game theory, machine learning, and advanced visualization to analyze and optimize Formula 1 race strategies. It enables simulation of Nash and Stackelberg strategies, trust dynamics visualization, and actionable insights from real F1 data.

---

## Features

- Analyze 2019â€“2021 F1 race data via FastF1.
- Simulate Nash (conservative) and Stackelberg (aggressive) strategies.
- Compute trust metrics from lap times and positions.
- Use Random Forest to identify key performance drivers.
- Visualize trust dynamics, game theory payoffs, and feature importance heatmaps.
- Provide driver-specific strategic recommendations.
- Demo mode with fallback data for presentation.

---

## Installation

- git clone https://github.com/mannatgoyal/trust-dynamics-motorsports.git
- cd trust-dynamics-motorsports
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- streamlit run f1_ai_strategist.py
  
---

## Usage

- Select year, track, and driver in the sidebar.
- View trust dynamics and strategy comparisons.
- Explore feature importance heatmap and game theory payoff matrix.
- Toggle advanced analysis for detailed insights.
- If live data is unavailable, demo data is shown automatically.

---

## Data Sources

- [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) for official timing and telemetry.
- Local CSV fallback for demo purposes.
