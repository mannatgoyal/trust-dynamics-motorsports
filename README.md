# Trust Dynamics in Motorsports

This project simulates trust evolution in competitive motorsports using game theory and reinforcement learning techniques. Inspired by Nicky Case's *The Evolution of Trust*, it applies similar concepts to motorsport-specific scenarios.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code for agents, environments, and utilities.
  - `agents/`: AI agent implementations.
  - `environments/`: Simulation environments.
  - `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities.
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.
- `docs/`: Documentation files.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for validating code functionality.

## Features

- Game-theoretic models based on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.
- AI-driven agent strategies from basic (Tit-for-Tat) to advanced (Deep Q-Learning).
- Integration with real-world motorsport data via the Ergast API.
- Visualizations of trust dynamics over time.
