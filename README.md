# Trust Dynamics in Motorsports

This project simulates trust evolution in competitive motorsports using game theory and reinforcement learning techniques. It's inspired by Nicky Case's "The Evolution of Trust" and applies similar concepts to the world of motorsports.

## Features
- Game-theoretic models based on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
- AI-driven agent strategies from basic (Tit-for-Tat) to advanced (Deep Q-Learning)
- Integration with real-world motorsport data via the Ergast API
- Visualizations of trust dynamics over time
